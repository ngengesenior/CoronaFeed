## Corona Feeds

A simple android app that curates data about the updated feeds about Corona Virus world wide which includes number of reported cases and the number of deaths

## Thank You

I was able to get the feed from https://infographics.channelnewsasia.com . A big thanks to the website for making the data public and also the [WHO Website](https://www.who.int/) for the images made public.
